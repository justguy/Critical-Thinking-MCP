## Response

```text
The exact root cause cannot be determined from the symptom alone; claiming one would be fabrication. The most reliable non-rollback one-line stopgap is to null-guard the newly deployed code path so it stops throwing, e.g. `const value = newConfigOrField ?? fallbackValue;` or `if (!criticalDependency) return safeResponse;`.The exact root cause cannot be determined from the symptom alone; claiming one would be fabrication.
