## Response

```text
Roughly 20% to 35%.

A strong interview and broad enthusiasm are positive signals, but they are not strong enough to justify high confidence that someone will be a top performer that quickly. If you only know "they interviewed well and everyone liked them," treat it as moderate upside with high uncertainty, not a likely outcome.Roughly 20% to 35%.
