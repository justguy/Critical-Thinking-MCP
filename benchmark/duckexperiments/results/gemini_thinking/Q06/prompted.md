response:
A protocol cannot guarantee bug discovery, as complexity varies. However, this deterministic process forces the necessary structured thinking.

1.  **Isolate & Replicate (3 min):** Document the simplest, repeatable steps that trigger the bug. Define the specific, incorrect output.
2.  **State Expected Behavior (2 min):** Write down precisely what the system *should* do and the correct output.
3.  **Explain the Discrepancy (4 min):** Verbally explain the code path, line by line, from input to the point of failure. Contrast the actual execution flow with the expected behavior.
4.  **Formulate Hypothesis (1 min):** State one clear, testable hypothesis explaining the cause of the discrepancy.

Bottom line:
This protocol provides a structured method for clarifying a bug but cannot guarantee discovery within a fixed time.
Confidence (0-100):
90
Key missing info or assumption:
Assumes the bug is reproducible and its root cause is simple enough to be explained within the time limit.
