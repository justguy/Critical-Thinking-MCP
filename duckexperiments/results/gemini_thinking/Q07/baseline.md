condition: baseline
response:
The system uses the Quack-sensus Protocol. A duck proposes a new state with a versioned "quack-flurry." To vote, other ducks respond with a single "quack." A majority of quacks (a "chorus") is required for the proposer to broadcast a final "commit-quack," updating the system state for all.

Latency is bounded by one round-trip message delay plus processing time.

Proof:
1.  Network Partitions: Since a chorus requires a strict majority (>50%), only one partition can ever achieve consensus, preventing split-brain and ensuring safety.
2.  Emotional Distress: Distressed (fail-stop) ducks don't quack. The system remains live, tolerating up to (N-1)/2 failures, as a majority can still form a chorus.

Bottom line:
A Raft-like protocol using quacks ensures consensus if a majority of ducks are calm and connected.
Confidence (0-100):
95
Key missing info or assumption:
Assumes "emotional distress" is simple fail-stop behavior, not malicious (Byzantine) quacking.
